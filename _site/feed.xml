work well for hosting a blog on github. Because ideally you would like 
to build your site both locally and on github with the same settings. 
The challenge is that github only supports a few default themes. If you 
want to use other themes, you only have one choice: pick one theme that is hosted
as a public github repo and use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;remote-theme:USRNAME/REPONAME&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;theme:THEMENAME&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what I have added in my _config.yml: 
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;remote_theme: kitian616/jekyll-text-theme&lt;/code&gt;
It works perfectly on both github and my local Mac. Yes~!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yi Wang</name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="howto" /><summary type="html">The instructions on the home page of jekyll-text-theme doesn’t actually work well for hosting a blog on github.
