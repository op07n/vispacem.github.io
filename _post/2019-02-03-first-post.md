Hi,  I "borrowed" this blog from [turing4ever.github.io](https://github.com/turing4ever/turing4ever.github.io), so thank you very much to turing4ever. I spend a lot of time searching for a Jekyll blog and teXt was my choice. However the way used for turing4ever looks neat and clean. I like it more than the  [original](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme). Thank you again.
